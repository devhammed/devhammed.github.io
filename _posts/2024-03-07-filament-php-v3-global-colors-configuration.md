Hello there, this is my first post on this blog, and you should be expecting more from me!

I will be sharing some tips on how to use FLAT Stack and other technologies to build web and mobile applications so stay tuned.

As we all know, Filament v3 introduced the concept of multiple panels but it also introduced a new way to configure CSS colors for branding (which is a step away from the v2 Tailwind CSS approach).

The above change is nice and all but it also means you will have to configure branding colors for each panel you create or does it?
